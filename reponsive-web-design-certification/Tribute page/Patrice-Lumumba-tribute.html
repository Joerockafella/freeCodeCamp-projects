       <h2>Here's a time line of Lumumba's life:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><b>2 July 1925:</b> - Born in Onalua in the Katakokombe region of the Kasai province of the Belgian Congo. Raised in a Catholic family, he was educated at a Protestant primary school, a Catholic missionary school, and finally the government post office training school, passing the one-year course with distinction. Lumumba spoke Tetela, French, Lingala, Swahili, and Tshiluba. </li><br>
              <li><b>In 1951:</b> - He married Pauline Opangu.  </li>
              <li><b>In 1955, :</b> - Lumumba became regional head of the Cercles of Stanleyville and joined the Liberal Party of Belgium, where he worked on editing and distributing party literature. </li>
              <li><b>In 1956:</b> - After traveling on a study tour in Belgium, he was arrested on charges of embezzlement from the post office. He was convicted and condemned one year later to twelve months’ imprisonment and a fine. </li><br>
              <li><b>on 5 October 1958:</b> - After his release, he helped found the Mouvement National Congolais (MNC) party, quickly becoming the organization's leader. The MNC, unlike other parties, did not draw on the unity of a particular ethnic base,[10] but promoted a platform that included independence, gradual Africanization of the government, state-led economic development, and neutrality in foreign affairs. </li><br>
              <li><b> in December 1958:</b> - Lumumba was one of the delegates that represented the MNC at the All-African Peoples' Conference in Accra, Ghana. At this international conference, hosted by Ghanaian President Kwame Nkrumah, Lumumba further solidified his Pan-Africanist beliefs. Nkrumah was personally impressed by Lumumba's intelligence and ability. </li><br>
              <li><b>In late October 1959:</b> - Lumumba, as leader of the organization, was arrested for inciting an anti-colonial riot in Stanleyville; 30 people were killed. He was sentenced to 69 months in prison. The trial's start date of 18 January 1960 was the first day of the Congolese Round Table Conference in Brussels to finalize the future of the Congo.Despite Lumumba's imprisonment at the time, the MNC won a convincing majority in the December local elections in the Congo. As a result of strong pressure from delegates upset with Lumumba's trial, he was released and allowed to attend the Brussels conference.  </li><br>
              <li><b> on 23 June 1960:</b> - The announcement of 34-year-old Lumumba as the Congo's first prime minister and Joseph Kasa-Vubu as its president.  </li>
              <li><b>On 30 June 1960:</b> - Independence Day was celebrated on 30 June in a ceremony attended by many dignitaries, including King Baudouin of Belgium and the foreign press. Lumumba, who was not scheduled to speak, delivered an impromptu speech that reminded the audience that the independence of the Congo was not granted magnanimously by Belgium </li><br>
              <li><b>The speech:</b> - [...] For this independence of the Congo, although being proclaimed today by agreement with Belgium, an amicable country, with which we are on equal terms, no Congolese worthy of the name will ever be able to forget that it was by fighting that it has been won, a day-to-day fight, an ardent and idealistic fight, a fight in which we were spared neither privation nor suffering, and for which we gave our strength and our blood. We are proud of this struggle, of tears, of fire, and of blood, to the depths of our being, for it was a noble and just struggle, and indispensable to put an end to the humiliating slavery which was imposed upon us by force. [...]  </li><br>
              <li><b>On 5 September 1960:</b> - He was dismissed from his post by President Kasa-Vubu. Though he was dismissed from his post, Parliament continued to recognize his authority. Lumumba rivaled his replacement, Iléo, over control of the government until a coup on 14 September definitively suspended the parliamentary system and removed both from power. </li><br>
              <li><b>Final days and execution :</b> - Lumumba was forcibly restrained on the flight to Elizabethville on 17 January 1961. On arrival, he and his associates were conducted under arrest to the Brouwez House where they were brutally beaten and tortured by Katangan and Belgian officers, later that night, Lumumba was driven to an isolated spot.The execution is thought to have taken place on 17 January 1961, between 21:40 and 21:43 (according to the Belgian report). The Belgians and their counterparts later wished to get rid of the bodies, and did so by digging up and dismembering the corpses, then dissolving them in sulfuric acid while the bones were ground and scattered.<b> He died at the age of 34.</b> </li><br>
              <li><b>A great african leader</b> - Patrice Lumumba was Prime Minister of The Congo for 80 days, from 24 June to 14 September 1960. To his supporters, Lumumba was an altruistic man of strong character. He favoured a unitary Congo and opposed division of the country along ethnic or regional lines. Like many other African leaders, he supported pan-Africanism and liberation for colonial territories. He proclaimed his regime one of "positive neutralism,"defined as a return to African values and rejection of any imported ideology, including that of the Soviet Union: "We are not Communists or Catholics. We are African nationalists." </li><br>
            <li><b>In 1964 :</b> - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_X" target="_blank">Malcolm X</a> declared Patrice Lumumba "the greatest black man who ever walked the African continent". </li>
